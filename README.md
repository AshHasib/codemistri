# CodeMistri

We are building an online judge system for people to improve their coding skills by solving different types of mathematical problems here.
Generally an OJ consists of problems and a range of test cases mapped with each of them. The test cases are tried against the problem submitted by
 the contestant and once he passes all, his code gets accepted.

 Once we are done building the whole thing, it will have the ability to - 

 - Profiles as a contestant or an administrator who can create problems
 - Submit codes for the problems already in the OJ
 - Create contests
 - Scoreboard system for the current users
 - Ranking system for all users
